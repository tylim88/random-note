for a long time I think that terminology is not important, my reason is as long as you know how it work, it doesnt matter how you call it
But I do not agree to this point anymore, my recent experience tell me that recognizing terminology actually improve understanding
it is like, if you know a person name, you understand him more
for example css terminology

when i go through these terminology, i feel like i have more understanding on CSS even though there is nothing new in it
I starting to think recognizing terminology is an important part of learning
